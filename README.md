# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The objective of this project is to prepare for a large number of employees who will be reaching retirement age at the same time. In preparing for the upcoming "silver tsunami" we need to know what titles the retirees hold and whom of these employees would be eligible for our mentorship program to mentor the next generation of employees. With those objectives in mind we had to look at databases of employees with the following information: names, dates of births, titles, and when those titles were held. We then had to join the related databases and create new tables and files to better organize the information.

Please see the three databases created below.

[retiring_titles.csv](./Data/retiring_titles.csv)

[unique_titles.csv](./Data/unique_titles.csv)

[mentorship_eligibility.csv](./Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)
